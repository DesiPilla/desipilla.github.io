			<br>
			I am currently a graduate student at the University of Delaware pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science. 
			At the age of 19, I completed my Honors Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering. I have strong interests in Artificial Intelligence
			and Machine Learning, with the future aspiration to apply these techniques in a useful manner. Most of my coursework is 
			grounded in machine learning projects where I am growing my skills and applying them to real-world issues.
			<br>
			<br>
			In my two internship experiences, I have developed a strong interest in data analysis. While working at W.L. Gore & Associates,
			I invested time into developing Excel tools that would expedite my projects. At DuPont, I created analytical tools in VBA and 
			MathCad to drive project decisions and accelerate progress.
			<br>
			<br>
			I founded the student organization Odyssey of the Mind (UDOM) my freshman year, and lead a team to the World Finals competition 
			following my sophomore year. My team constructed a human-powered vehicle that had to complete an obstacle course. My team competed 
			against colleges from all over the world and won first place in the tournament.
			<br>
			<br>
			My biggest hobbies include rock climbing, personal finance, genealgoy, coding, and beach volleyball.

				<p class="project-info">Apr 2020 – May 2020</p>
				<p class="project-description"><b>Description:</b>
				An important field of data science is sentiment analysis, which uses natural language processing to extract certain emotions
				of feelings from text. The main goal of this project is to build and train a model that can detect the sentiment of a tweet. 
				For simplicity, this model limit its scope to label all tweets as either <em>negative</em>, <em>neutral</em>, or <em>positive</em>.
				<ul>
					<li>Applied natural language processing techniques using nltk to preprocess tweets</li>
					<li>Explored several machine learning methods in Scikit-learn (SVM, Random Forests, Naïve Bayes, Gradient Descent, KNN, Perceptron, and Logistic Regression)
					to classify tweets as ‘negative’, ‘neutral’, or positive’</li>
					<li>Achieved 77.94% model accuracy by performing cross-validation to achieve the optimal estimator</li>

				This project aims to discover the relationships between demographic features and Voter ID laws, demographic features and voter turnout,
				and Voter ID laws and voter turnout. 
				<ul>
					<li>Conducted ANOVA tests to determine conditional relationships between demographics, ID laws, and turnout.</li>
					<li>Performed k-Means clustering to see if Voter ID laws were aligned with certain demographic groups </li>
					<li>Predicted voter turnout using Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Descent methods.

				<p class="project-info">Mar 2020 – May 2020</p>
				<p class="project-description"><b>Description:</b> 
				Energy consumption forecasting is vitally important for both energy companies and government agencies to properly hedge their assets and to ensure sustainability and access to the resource.
				Using historical weather data for the city of Boston (2000 to 2019), we performed a statistical analysis of energy forecasting for the New England region. Two different models using Facebook’s Prophet
				package and feedforward neural networks were developed to forecast load upto 90 days in advance.
				<ul>
					<li>Designed an additive regression model using Facebook’s Prophet to forecast future energy demand in the New England region</li>
					<li>Obtained a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 7.45% on hourly predictions and 2.35% on 3-month cumulative load consumption</li>

				<p class="project-description"><b>Description:</b> The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that increases the profit realized by investors. This goal will be acheived by using two models,
				a Logistic Regression and Neural Network. The data was scraped from the internet for individual stocks. This includes daily price and trading data, as well as earnings data for every quarter since 1995.
				The scraped data was manipulated to calculate a variety of value- and momentum-based metrics. More info can be seen in the full report.

				<p class="project-info">Course: Fundamentals of Astrophysics (PHYS 333)</p> 
				<p class="project-info">Mar 2019 – May 2019</p>
				<p class="project-description"><b>Description:</b> In our universe, there are countless systems containing more than one body. Our solar system alone contains a star and eight
				(or nine, depending on who you ask) planets, along with many smaller asteroids and debris. Our galaxy is comprised of around 200 billion stars and a super-massive black hole at
				its center. Where, then, lies the dilemma of having more than two bodies in orbit? Well, these systems essentially function as independent binary systems overlaid on top on one another.
				Our solar system is practically a bunch of binary systems between the sun and an individual planet; the planets themselves are not massive enough to cause the sun to move very 
				much and are far enough away from each other that they do not interact much with one another. The ¬n¬-body problem comes into play when the bodies in the system are all of comparable
				mass and interact with each of the other bodies in the system.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Created a Python simulator to investigate the N-Body problem in Astronomy</li>
					<li>Investigated the interactions of local systems and searched for trends</li>
					<li>Incorporated Matplotlib, Turtle, NumPy, and other packages to analyze velocity and motion patterns</li>
